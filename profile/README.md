## WatsonX Agents Hub
The WatsonX Agents Hub project provides a simple and interactive way to generate agents on watsonx.ai on the fly.
It uses a wizard that collects user requirements and configures a new agent automatically based on a selected framework.
This tool supports multiple base frameworks and offers the option to customize the agent code using AI-powered logic.
