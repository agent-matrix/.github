## ü§ñ What is Agent-Matrix?

Welcome to Agent-Matrix! This GitHub organization is a curated collection of enterprise-ready AI agents, specifically designed for seamless integration with **IBM WatsonX Orchestrate** and **MCP Gateway**.

Every repository you find here is a functional, deployable agent created by the **[agent-generator](https://github.com/ruslanmv/agent-generator)** tool. Our mission is to provide powerful, out-of-the-box solutions that bridge the gap between custom Python tools and robust, enterprise-grade AI orchestration platforms.

## ‚ú® The Core Capability: From Custom Tool to Enterprise Skill

The true power of the agents in this hub is their ability to transform standalone Python scripts into fully managed and orchestrated enterprise skills.

All agents here follow a specific, powerful pattern:

1.  **Import Custom Tools**: They are built to wrap around custom Python logic (e.g., a script for document processing, data analysis, or API interaction).
2.  **Native MCP Gateway Integration**: Each agent exposes a standard `/invoke` endpoint via a built-in FastAPI server. This allows **MCP Gateway** to manage, monitor, and create dashboards for agent performance and usage out-of-the-box.
3.  **Seamless WatsonX Orchestrate Import**: Each agent includes a pre-generated `skill.yaml` definition. This allows you to import the agent directly into your **WatsonX Orchestrate** environment as a new, native skill, ready to be used in complex automations.

This architecture means you can take any custom logic, use the generator to wrap it, and instantly have a manageable, observable, and orchestratable enterprise AI asset.

## üìÇ What You'll Find Here

Each repository in Agent-Matrix represents a unique agent designed for the WatsonX ecosystem. A typical repository includes:

* **WatsonX Orchestrate Ready**: A `skill.yaml` file for immediate, native import into your Orchestrate skill catalog.
* **MCP Gateway Ready**: A built-in FastAPI server exposing a standard endpoint for instant management and dashboarding.
* **Custom Tool Integration**: A clear structure, usually in a `/tools` directory, where the core Python logic lives, ready for your inspection and customization.
* **A Detailed `README.md`**: Step-by-step instructions on how to configure, run, and import that specific agent.
* **Full Configuration**: All necessary files like `requirements.txt`, `.env.template`, and `Dockerfile` for rapid deployment.

##  guiding principles

* **Enterprise-Focused**: Our primary goal is to produce agents that solve real-world business problems within a robust, secure, and manageable enterprise framework.
* **Seamless Integration**: We prioritize out-of-the-box compatibility. Agents are designed to work flawlessly with WatsonX Orchestrate and MCP Gateway with minimal configuration.
* **Production-Ready**: These are not just prototypes. They are deployable artifacts with server endpoints and containerization support, built for stability and performance.
* **Open & Extensible**: Every agent is a powerful foundation. We encourage you to fork these repositories, customize the core tools, and adapt them to your unique challenges.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

This organization is a showcase of generated artifacts. Therefore, the contribution model is unique:

**To contribute to the Agent-Matrix ecosystem, please contribute directly to the `agent-generator` project.**

By improving the generator, you improve every agent that will ever be created. We welcome contributions of all kinds:

* **[Submit an Issue](https://github.com/ruslanmv/agent-generator/issues)** to report a bug or suggest a new feature for the generator.
* **[Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/ruslanmv/agent-generator/pulls)** to enhance the WatsonX templates, add new features, or improve the generation logic.

## üìÑ License

All agent repositories within this organization are generated under the **Apache 2.0 License**, the same license as the `agent-generator` tool itself.
